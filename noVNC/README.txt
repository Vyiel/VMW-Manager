Not uploading the noVNC files as its not mine to upload. 
Please clone the package from: https://github.com/novnc/noVNC

I am just uploading the directory as it's setup to work from within this folder only in the codes. 
Also, I have changed the original vnc_lite.html to 
    - Not prompt for password and use a default one statically set
    - Use the same GLOBAL and SESSION variables used in the main project.

It's upon your discretion to use my settings or not. Just uploading in case...
